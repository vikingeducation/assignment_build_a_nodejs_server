# Building a Node.js Server

In this assignment I built my own Node.js server. It dives into serving an HTML page as well as dynamically inserting the data from the request and response objects!


## Getting Started

If you have [installed node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) on your computer, type the following commands

```
$ node app.js
```
